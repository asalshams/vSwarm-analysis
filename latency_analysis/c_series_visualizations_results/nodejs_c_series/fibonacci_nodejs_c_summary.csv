# Nodejs-Series Performance Summary Table
# ===============================================
# 
# Max_Throughput_RPS: Average of maximum RPS achieved across all iterations
#                   (more conservative metric than single peak performance)
# 
# Latency metrics: Average latency across iterations at the RPS level where
#                 the highest actual RPS was achieved (represents realistic
#                 performance under peak load conditions)
# 
# Configuration: C1 (1 pod, 2000m CPU) to C5 (8 pods, 200m CPU each)
# C1-C3 maintain constant total resources (2000m CPU, 2Gi memory); C4-C5 use fewer total resources
# but vary pod count and containerConcurrency for scaling analysis
