# Go-Series Performance Summary Table
# ===============================================
# 
# Max_Throughput_RPS: Average of maximum RPS achieved across all iterations
#                   (more conservative metric than single peak performance)
# 
# Latency metrics: Average latency across iterations at the RPS level where
#                 the highest actual RPS was achieved (represents realistic
#                 performance under peak load conditions)
# 
# Configuration: B1 (1 pod, 1000m CPU) to B5 (10 pods, 100m CPU each)
# All configurations maintain constant total resources (1000m CPU, 1Gi memory)
# but vary pod count and containerConcurrency for scaling analysis
